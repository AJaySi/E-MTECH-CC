# MTek SavAIr
IMPORTANT: This is a weekend project with strong coffee Jsüòâ. Presently, 'just for friends' development stage, WIP.

Talk/Chat with EMtech course material. Personalized AI Mtech Tutor for Executives.
Present functionality, upload a single e-mtech-cc pdf and ask questions around it. Pretty basic.
A feeble attempt is made to personlize AI tutor as per student's learning preferances.

> [!NOTE] <p> Use single pdf upload, as the idea is to quality check AI responses for a small sample space(S).
> [How to Prompt AI tutor](https://github.com/AJaySi/E-MTECH-CC/wiki/How-to-prompt-emtech-chatbot)</p>
> FUTURE: Will include support for Multiple PDF upload.

## Hers's the Plan: (Hold the Beer)

- Provide AI tooling for E-MTECH_CC students to learn with AI. Abstracting AI tech from them to focus on the course itself.
- Aimed at being student's AI assistant, specilizing in course material of e-MTECH-CC IIT Patna.
- Provide a framework to play with & also personlize learning as per their temperment and AI powered.
- Integrate/Encapsulate Latest AI tech for making learning easier for E-MTECH students.
- Integrate personlity to AI to tailor response as per each students liking, level etc. Hyper personlized learning.
- Personalized learning: It'll tailor your learning experience. No one will ever know you don't understand anything!
- Taps into the stored vectors, providing accurate and context-aware responses from course documents (Lets Hope).
- Hyper-personalized learning: It's like reading your mind... but we haven't quite figured that part out yet.

> [!NOTE] <p>A Super-teacher who will never tire of your questions and tailor response as you would like to learn.</p>

## üèÉHow to Run:üèÉ Getting Started:

For MTECH students:

- Clone this repo. (You know how to do that, right?)

- Install the requirements.txt 
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Run the App as:
- `streamlit run emtech_savior.py`

- Visit the web URL. (Hopefully, it'll work... fingers crossed!).

<details><summary><h3>Features & Usecases</h3></summary>
1). Input slide page contents and ask questions, clarifications, examples etc
2). Input course video for speech to text, get summary, 'what the professor said', 'student questions' etc
Note: 'Sir, please stop video recording', not required as the AI model recognises the main speakers and only transcribes their part.
This is speech diarization.
3). Python code interpetor is present and hence AI can code along with you and explain programming, 'n' number of times.
4). There are inputs which are present to abstract prompting and provide right answers.
5). Multilingual : Convert speech, text, slides to any language you are most comfortable with.
6). Supports Text, Video, Image from PDF & PPT files.

NOTE: To Err is Human & AI...

## üöß Implementation Details & Design considerations:

1). Avoid Using standard RAG libraries like langchain, llamaindex, dify, haystack etc. 
Implementation is easier, community support & sh-t-like-that. 
Heavy libs, lesser customizations and whats the fun in using them.

2). Lets build our own RAG and make mistakes around it.

3). PPTs, PDFs, videos are unstructured data and difficult to preprocess for data. 
Different vendors, formats, codecs make it difficult to parse all. llamaparse is good option, after we fail at it.

4). Multimodal AI models are great at extracting data from unstructured data. Imagine giving eyes to your programs.

5). More powerful AI models will give better results, Get your own expensive APIs. Cheapest-APIs-first.

6). Python-Only approach for full stack streamlit app. ü§ò We're keeping it simple... for now.

7). Tech-stack: Python, Google AI, FAISS, Streamlit, chromaDB, PyPDF2 etc

Irony: We started this project, as finding time is Not as simple as 'Import time'.
Please contribute, Dont ask questions, features, Criticise. In Active Developement.
Remember - Its a Free tool & NOT included in your course fee.
